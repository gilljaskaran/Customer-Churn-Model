# Customer-Churn-Model
Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using various algorithms. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and predictive analysis to help businesses understand factors that influence customer retention.

Features Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, performs encoding for categorical features, and scales data to improve model performance.

Model Training: Includes training on multiple algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to identify the best model for churn prediction.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.

Prediction: Generates predictions on customer churn likelihood using the trained model. Dataset

The model operates on a customer dataset with features like:

Customer demographics

Subscription details

Usage metrics

Customer support interactions

Usage

Load Data: Load the customer dataset in the notebook.

Run Cells: Execute cells to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

Experiment: Modify parameters or try different models to explore results further.

Interpret Predictions: Analyze the output to gain insights into factors influencing churn.
